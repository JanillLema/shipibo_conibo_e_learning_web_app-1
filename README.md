# Background

Aquínti was our final project for a Columbia University course titled Multilingual Technologies and Language Diversity, which explores the impact of digital technologies on the ecosystem of language diversity.

In recent years, tools have been built to revitalize the Shipibo-Conibo language; however, these tools are only accessible to researchers and technologists. Therefore, for our final project, we chose to create an e-Learning web app because we wanted to have an impact on the Shipibo-Conibo Community directly. We hope that Aquínti is a great aid to those who wish to recuperate an essential aspect of their ancestors’ history.
