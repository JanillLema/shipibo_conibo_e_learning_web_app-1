# TRANSLATION MODEL FILES
# The directory where the translation model tables as created
# by Giza are located:
#
# Notes: - All translation model "source" files are assumed to be in
#          TM_RawDataDir, the binaries will be put in TM_BinDataDir
#
#        - Attention: RELATIVE PATH NAMES DO NOT WORK!!!
#
#        - Absolute paths (file name starts with /) will override
#          the default directory.

TM_RawDataDir = word_alignment/
TM_BinDataDir = word_alignment/

# file names of the TM tables
# Notes:
# 1. TTable and InversTTable are expected to use word IDs not
#    strings (Giza produces both, whereby the *.actual.* files
#    use strings and are THE WRONG CHOICE.
# 2. FZeroWords, on the other hand, is a simple list of strings
#    with one word per line. This file is typically edited
#    manually. Hoeever, this one listed here is generated by GIZA
